# Handlebar


## What is Mustache?

[Mustache][1] is a HTML template engine

Mustache's main strengths are:

- it's much simpler than other template engines such as [Twig][2] and [Smarty][3] and therefore quicker to learn

- it's implemented in all major web programming languages so Mustache templates can be used on different platforms without amendment

- it forces developers to separate view logic from markup so HTML files are more readable

## What is Handlebar?

Handlebar is a simple class that extends Justin's Mustache class so it can be used in Kohana applications.  

[!!] Handlebar is intended as a replacement for standard Kohana Views.
